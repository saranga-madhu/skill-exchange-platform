MYSQL error fix 
	go to:
		C:\xampp\mysql\  -> data 
		1.rename data file as 'data_old'
		2.Create a NEW folder named: 'data'
		3.Go to:
			C:\xampp\mysql\backup
		4.Copy ALL files & folders inside backup
		5.Paste them into:
			C:\xampp\mysql\data
		6.Recreate database:
			CREATE DATABASE skillexchange;
			USE skillexchange;
		7.Run seed again
		 From backend folder:
		 node seeddata.js

You should finally see:
✅ Database seeded successfully!

If not ----,
 FIX server.js in THIS LINE

Change it to match the exact filename:

	const seedData = require("./seeddata");

(OR rename file to seedData.js — both are OK, but names must match)

*Restart backend:

	Ctrl + C
	npm start

*Run seed:
Now insert dummy data:
	node seeddata.js
	
		Expected output:
			🌱 Seeding database...
			Creating users...
			Creating skills...
			Creating requests...
			Creating messages...
		✅ Database seeded successfully!
